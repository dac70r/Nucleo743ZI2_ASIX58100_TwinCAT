# Nucleo-743ZI & ASIX58100 Dev Board 

This project involves the interface between a Nucleo743Zi2 microcontroller and a EtherCAT Slave Controller Asix58100 in the form of Evaluation Board.

The project can be split into 2 parts:
- Part1 is the EtherCAT Slave Controller configuration. 
- Part2 is the microcontroller coding. 

# Expected Results

In TwinCAT, it can be observed that under "input" the data reflects the value that was preset by the user.
